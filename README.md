# Verilog-for-Dummies

## Preparing

1.  Choose / Check your computer you're like to use for this Workshop:
   *  best Tool support you'll get with Ubuntu 16.04 or hence Mint 18
   *  much RAM (not smaller than 2 GB)

2.  Clone this github.com Repository to your computer by
```
git clone https://github.com/chipforge/Verilog-for-Dummies.git
```

3.  Please go to the Scripts/bash directory, read and run the install.sh script

4.  Do you have already installed a text editor? Really? I mean _vim_ or _emacs_. We do not talk about _notepad++_, _nedit_ or something for web hipsters with mouse support only
   *  BTW, in the Scripts/vim directory you might find a minimalistic and useful vim configuration; move _vimrc_ to _~/.vimrc_ before usage.
